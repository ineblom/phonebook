# Phonebook

The concept behind Phonebook is simple yet powerful: by analyzing who has each other in their contacts,
we can map out social connections and discover patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. The project
creates a visual graph representation of these connections, allowing users to explore their place in the
broader social network.

This is the backend. A react native client can be found [here](https://www.github.com/ineblom/phonebook_client).

## Features

- Interactive graph visualization of contact networks. Streaming in nodes as you explore.
- Discover mutual connections and relationship patterns.
- Identify clusters and communities within your network.
- Search and explore your extended network.
